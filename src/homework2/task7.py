'''We add a Leap Day on February 29, almost every four years.
The leap day is an extra, or intercalary day and we add it to
the shortest month of the year, February.
In the Gregorian calendar three criteria must be taken into account to identify
leap years:
The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
This means that in the Gregorian calendar,
the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years,
while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years.
Task
You are given the year, and you have to write a function
to check if the year is leap or not.
Note that you have to complete the function and
remaining code is given as template.

'''A group of friends want to buy a bouquet of flowers.
The florist wants to maximize his number of new customers and the money he makes.
To do this, he decides he'll multiply the price of each flower by the number
of that customer's previously purchased flowers plus 1.
The first flower will be original price, (0 + 1) x original price,
the next will be (1 + 1) x original price and so on.
Given the size of the group of friends, the number of flowers
they want to purchase and the original prices of the flowers,
determine the minimum cost to purchase all of the flowers.
For example, if there are k = 3 friends that want to buy n = 4 flowers
that cost c = [1, 2, 3, 4] each will buy one of the flowers priced [2, 3, 4]
at the original price. Having each purchased x = 1 flower,
the first flower in the list,
c[0], will now cost (current purchase + previous purchases) x c[0] = (1+1)x1=2.
The total cost will be 2 + 3 + 4 + 2 = 11.
